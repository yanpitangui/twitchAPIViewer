# twitchAPIViewer
A freeCodeCamp project.

<h3>Build a TwitchTV API Viewer</h3>

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.<br />

User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.<br>
User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.<br>
User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
